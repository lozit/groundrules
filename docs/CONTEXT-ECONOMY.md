# Context economy — how groundrules keeps docs exhaustive *and* cheap

## The principle: storage ≠ loading

Two things people conflate:

- **Storage** — how much documentation the project *has*. Should be **exhaustive**. Lives
  on disk (`docs/`, ADRs, `intake/`). Costs nothing to keep; unlimited.
- **Loading** — how much of it sits in the model's context *for the current task*. Should
  be **minimal** — only what this task needs.

"Exhaustive" and "token-efficient" only seem to conflict if you fuse these. Keep them
separate and there is no tradeoff: write everything down, load almost none of it.

## Yes, too much context is counterproductive — it's measured

This isn't folklore. It's true on two independent grounds:

- **Empirically.** Chroma's 2025 *context rot* study tested 18 frontier models (including
  Claude Opus 4): **every one degrades as input grows**, at every length increment — not
  just on needle-in-a-haystack but on real tasks. The classic **"lost in the middle"**
  effect: models attend well to the **start and end** of the window and accuracy drops
  **30%+** for information in the middle (when the window is <50% full; past 50% it shifts
  to favoring the most recent tokens). Attention is a **finite budget** — every token you
  add depletes what's left for the tokens that matter.
- **Anthropic says so too.** The Claude Code docs recommend keeping `CLAUDE.md`
  **under 200 lines** and state that **"larger files produce lower adherence."** Same
  phenomenon, acknowledged by the vendor. (Bonus: editing a big always-loaded file
  **busts the prompt cache**, so every edit re-bills the whole file.)

So "put everything in `CLAUDE.md` so Claude has it" actively *hurts* — it dilutes
attention and costs more.

## Index vs documentation-search plugin: settle the debate

A common online claim: a **doc-search / RAG plugin** (an MCP server that semantically
searches docs) "uses fewer tokens." Half-true — it depends entirely on *whose* docs:

| | **Your own project docs** (in your repo) | **A large external corpus** (a framework's full docs, an SDK — thousands of pages you don't own) |
|---|---|---|
| **Best tool** | **Index in `CLAUDE.md` + on-demand `Read`/`grep`** | A **doc-search / RAG MCP server** (Context7, devdocs…) |
| **Why** | The agent reads your repo *natively*. A file is exactly as long as you wrote it, read once when needed, and **cached**. Zero server overhead. | You can't (and shouldn't) load whole doc sets; semantic search returns just the relevant paragraph. |
| **Token cost** | ~the few lines of the index at startup; a file's tokens only when actually read | ~120 tokens for tool *names* at startup (schemas are *deferred* by default), then the schema (100–500 tok) + the returned snippet on use |

The "fewer tokens" claim is true **relative to dumping an entire external doc set into
context** — but **not** relative to a good index over your own repo, which is even cheaper
*and* native. Worse, the "50k tokens burned before you type" horror stories come from MCP
servers that inject full schemas **every turn**. Adding a RAG layer over *your own* repo
buys fuzzy retrieval and infrastructure for **zero benefit** — Claude already `grep`s and
`Read`s your files.

**Verdict:** for the project's own documentation, **the index wins** — and that's what
groundrules generates. A doc-search plugin solves a *different* problem (huge external
reference you can't fit), not this one.

**Reaching for the external-corpus tool when you do need it.** For that case — a large,
heterogeneous body you don't own and can't read whole (a framework's docs, a big unfamiliar
codebase, a pile of papers) — the right fit is a **doc-search MCP** (Context7, devdocs…) or
a **GraphRAG / knowledge-graph** tool such as [graphify](https://github.com/safishamsi/graphify)
(it parses code/docs/media into a queryable graph). These live **outside** groundrules — it
takes no dependency on them; this guide only tells you *when* to reach for one. A caveat that
keeps them in their lane: their output is *derived and probabilistic* (inferred edges, fuzzy
retrieval), so use them to **comprehend** a corpus, not as the source of truth — the curated,
exact docs stay in the repo.

## The full ladder: progressive disclosure

Best practice is to layer the project so each piece loads only when relevant. From
cheapest-always-on to loaded-only-on-need:

| Layer | What it holds | When it enters context |
|---|---|---|
| **`CLAUDE.md` (< 200 lines)** | Durable rules + the **index** (session-start read order + file map) | Every session start (re-injected after compaction). Keep it a map. |
| **`docs/` files** | The exhaustive content (vision, architecture, learnings, ADRs…) | **On demand**, when a task needs a specific file (cached). |
| **`.claude/rules/*.md` with `paths:`** | Domain rules scoped to file types | Only when a matching file is read. |
| **Skills (`SKILL.md`)** | Specialized procedures | Name+description in the index; **body on invoke**. `disable-model-invocation: true` keeps even the description out until called. |
| **Subagents** | Heavy reading / research | File reads happen in the *subagent's* window; only the summary returns to yours. |
| **MCP servers** | External tools / corpora | Tool names at startup; **schemas deferred** until a tool is called. Only for what your repo can't provide natively. |

The rule of thumb: **`CLAUDE.md` is a map, not the territory.** It points; the territory is
read on demand.

## How groundrules embodies this

A groundrules-generated project is already built on this ladder:

- The generated **`CLAUDE.md`** opens with **"Session start — read first, in order"** (an
  ordered pointer list) and a **"Key files and folders"** map — an index, not a dump.
- The exhaustive content lives in **`docs/`** (VISION, ARCHITECTURE, DATA_MODEL, LEARNINGS,
  decisions/…) and **`intake/`**, read when a task needs them.
- The CLAUDE.md template points at **`.claude/rules/*.md`** with `paths:` frontmatter for
  scoped rules.
- The **"repo is the only memory"** convention (ADR 0020) keeps knowledge on disk, where it
  can be loaded selectively — not in an agent's volatile, always-on memory.

The decision to keep it this way (index over RAG for own docs) is recorded in
[ADR 0021](decisions/0021-context-economy-index-over-doc-search.md).
