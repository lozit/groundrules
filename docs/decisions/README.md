# Architecture Decisions (ADR)

This folder contains the project's **Architecture Decision Records**: each structural decision made during the project is recorded in a file.

## Format

Inspired by [Michael Nygard](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions). See `0000-template.md`.

## Naming convention

`NNNN-title-kebab.md` where NNNN is a 4-digit incremental integer.

Examples:
- `0001-database-choice.md`
- `0002-auth-pattern.md`

## When to create an ADR

When a decision:
- has a **long-term impact** on the architecture
- is **hard to reverse**
- has **explicit tradeoffs** worth documenting
- might be **revisited later** (better to freeze the context now)

No ADR needed for trivial choices or implementation details.
