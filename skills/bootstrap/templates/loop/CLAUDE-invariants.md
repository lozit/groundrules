What the autonomous loop (`loop/`) must **never** break — the verifier checks the diff against this
section every iteration, and the maker treats a would-be violation as a `BLOCKED`, not a judgement
call. Keep it short and checkable; state your own:

- <fill in — e.g. the build/test suite stays green>
- <fill in — e.g. no secrets, credentials, or `.env` values committed>
- <fill in — e.g. public API / DB schema not changed without an ADR>
- <fill in — e.g. no edit outside the task's stated scope>
