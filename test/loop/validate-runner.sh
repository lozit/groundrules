# validate-runner.sh — the DETERMINISTIC layer of the loop validation suite.
#
# It proves the only executable piece of the loop — run-loop.sh — is safe, WITHOUT an LLM:
# a stub `claude` on PATH emits scripted output, so we can assert the anti-runaway MAX cap, the
# DONE stop, and one-fresh-invocation-per-iteration with exact, repeatable results (zero tokens).
#
# The behavioural layer (does the maker/verifier prompt logic actually converge / reject / block?)
# is LLM-driven and lives in WALKTHROUGH.md (subagent-simulated or a live `claude -p` run).
#
# Usage:  bash test/loop/validate-runner.sh [path/to/run-loop.sh]
# Default runner: the shipped template (skills/bootstrap/templates/loop/run-loop.sh).
